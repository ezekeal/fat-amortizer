fat-amortizer
=============
The goal of this project was to learn JQuery by making a (somewhat) useful app.

## Motive

The idea behind the app, besides learning JQuery is to attach real time frames to results.
I believe that making results tangible and visual can increase motivation.

## Assumptions

The numbers make big assumptions
* You maintain at least an average of the appropriate calories
* There is enough protein in your diet to maintain muscle
* Strength workouts 2 to 3 times a week.

## Usage

1. enter weight
2. select gender
3. enter bodyfat percentage
  * If you don't know your bodyfat percentage, you may select a picture
  * The amount will automatically be placed in the text box for adjustments if necessary
4. select your caloric defict (how much less you intend to eat than your maintenance calories)
5. TA-DA your results are displayed
  * variables of interest are displayed
  * pictures of each body fat milestone are displayed with target dates
